    I <strike>aim to become</strike> <sup>am</sup> the 2nd best Software Developer in the world. Wondering
    how/why?
</p>
<ul>
    <li>there's absolutely ZERO competition for this, it's just me alone</li>
    <li>no one argues when I claim this title, complete silence, as if noone cares</li>
    <li>
        but what noone realises is that this title comes with the power to gatekeep the best's title, so I am the
        one with the highest responsibility in tech community because with great power comes great ..., okay! okay!
        you already heard that before
    </li>
    <li>everyone in the room loves me & wants to impress me now (refer last point to know why)</li>
    <li>
        I can have my peace of mind when I am wrong because hey!, I am not the best, so I might make some mistakes
    </li>
    <li>
        I improve myself daily on this never-ending pursuit of becoming the best and think of ways the best (my
        hypothetical mentor) would have done it better
    </li>
    <li>
        I remain humble and listen to my juniors & seniors alike [wait!, did I mention that I am also the 3rd best
        listener, well! another time]
    </li>
    <li>
        [REMOVE] Software Development will always be challenging & intresting for me because I will never become the
        best will
        never go boring for me because I don't want to become the best & stop learning (from my hypothetical mentor)
        (also I don't want to give away this hard-earned title)
    </li>
    <li>
        and thank god that no one remembers the 2nd best, I don't want to be remembered. As long as my code runs
        smoothly I am happy & satisfied (even if dead), when it doesn't then I have to take birth to fix it
    </li>
</ul>
